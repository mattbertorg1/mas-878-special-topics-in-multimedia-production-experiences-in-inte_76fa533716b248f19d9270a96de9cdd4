There are three assignments during the course of the semester, and they are described here.

First Assignment
----------------

Put together a short personal presentation describing:

1.  Your interest or past involvement with interactive art.
2.  Any ideas you might have for creating an art piece.

Please build your presentations as something that can be put online - html pages, FlashTM animations, and QuickTime® movies are all great.

Midterm Assignment
------------------

Put together a proposal outlining the art piece you would like to create for the final class exhibition and present your ideas to the class. As in the first assignment, the assignment should be presentable online.

Final Assignment
----------------

Create an art piece that can be shown at the final class exhibition at CAVS. You may work alone or in collaboration. Interactive pieces are strongly encouraged.
